The AI engineer successfully established a Next.js (TypeScript, Tailwind, Shadcn UI) application for CBSE Class 12 AI projects. Key challenges included resolving Next.js 16/Turbopack compatibility issues by enforcing webpack, and managing dynamic routing for project slugs. The development progressed through two main phases: enhancing existing projects with visual outputs and completing the remaining projects. Initially, 4 out of 6 core projects received interactive visualizations. Subsequently, 6 new traditional ML projects were added, including Python code and console outputs. A critical oversight was identified and corrected: visualization components for these new projects were missing. After creation and integration, the system hit a memory limit during testing but recovered. The trajectory concludes with 12 out of 20 projects having visualizations, all 20 with runnable Python code and console outputs. The immediate next step is to address security concerns regarding API keys before a Git push.

<product_requirements>
The objective is to deliver a fully functional, deployable website featuring 20 runnable AI projects tailored for CBSE Class 12 students. Each project must exceed 300 lines of Python code, be fully executable, display comprehensive text-based and graphical outputs (e.g., confusion matrices, charts), and allow one-click export to a Word document including code and screenshots. The site requires Home, Projects (filterable), Project Detail (interactive demo, Monaco editor, metrics, visualizations), About, and CBSE Mapping pages, with global search. Pyodide or pure JS should handle demos. UI/UX must be clean, responsive, accessible, using Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn UI, without paid APIs or secrets. Projects need small, in-repo datasets with deterministic outputs. So far, 20 projects are implemented with Python code and console output, and 12 projects feature interactive visualizations.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend:** Next.js (React, TypeScript, App Router), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Monaco Editor.
-   **AI Runtime:** Pyodide (in-browser Python execution).
-   **Data Management:**  (for project metadata).
-   **Document Export:**  npm package (planned).
-   **Charting/Visuals:** Recharts, Radix UI Progress.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application features a Next.js (React/TypeScript) frontend with a structured directory.



-   **next.config.js**: Next.js configuration. Modified to include  configuration for compatibility with Next.js 16 and to disable Turbopack via .
-   **package.json**: Manages project dependencies (React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Pyodide, Monaco Editor, Recharts, Radix UI).
-   **src/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx**: The dynamic project detail page. This file received extensive modifications.
    -   It now includes state management for  and  to track project execution.
    -   It dynamically imports and renders various visualization components (, , , , , , , , , , , , , ) based on the .
    -   The  function within this file was significantly expanded to provide detailed, step-based console outputs for all 20 projects, including specific outputs for Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Means, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Network, Naive Bayes, CNN, PCA, Time Series, and Ensemble.
    -   The layout for the Run Demo tab was adjusted to accommodate both text-based console output and graphical visualizations.
-   **src/data/projects.json**: Stores metadata for all 20 AI projects, including slugs, titles, and descriptions. It was critical for identifying correct project slugs.
-   **src/projects/\*.py**: This directory now contains 20 Python files, each representing an AI project (e.g., , , , , , , , ). All are confirmed to be 300+ lines.
-   **src/components/visualizations/\*.tsx**: A new directory for visualization components. The following components have been created and integrated:
    -   
    -   
    -   
    -    (generic progress component)
    -   
    -   
    -   
    -   
    -   
    -   
    -   
    -   
    -   
    -   
    -   
    These components are responsible for rendering project-specific graphs, charts, and diagrams.
-   **src/components/ui/progress.tsx**: Radix UI's progress component, used for visual progress indication during project execution.
-   **src/components/ui/card.tsx**: Shadcn UI card component, used for structuring visualizations and outputs.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Integrate graphical representations and visual outputs for the remaining 8 projects.
-   Fully implement the Word export utility (screenshot capture and .docx generation).
-   Implement global search functionality.
-   Ensure mobile-friendliness and accessibility features.
-   Develop unit tests for the export utility and smoke tests for project execution.
-   Configure Prettier and ESLint.
-   Create README and CONTRIBUTING.md documentation.
-   Perform security check for sensitive keys (e.g., OpenAI, anon key) before Git push.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with providing a preview of the completed work. The engineer successfully restarted the frontend server (after a memory limit issue caused reinitialization), and took screenshots of the Home page, Projects page (showing 20 of 20 projects), and the Neural Network project detail page with its visualization loading. The preview summary confirmed the home and projects pages are functional, and the Neural Network project displays its architecture diagram and console output.

The user then explicitly requested to work on left projects, referring to the remaining projects that still lack graphical visualizations. The AI engineer has identified these 8 projects: , , , , , , , and . The engineer has begun creating visualization components for the first two:  and . The very last user request was to push it to git but before that ensure that all important keys like openai key and anon key is stored in env not be shared for public view to keep it safe then push it to git, which the engineer acknowledged.

<optional_next_step>
Check for hardcoded sensitive keys, move them to environment variables, and then continue creating visualization components for the remaining 8 projects.
