The previous AI engineer initiated the development of a CBSE Class 12 AI projects website from an empty repository. A Next.js (TypeScript, Tailwind, Shadcn UI) frontend was established, including key dependencies like Pyodide, Monaco Editor, and  for future export. A 6-phase plan guided the implementation, focusing on incremental progress.

After setting up the basic site structure and navigation, six AI projects with over 300 lines of Python code each were created. The engineer successfully debugged and resolved critical configuration issues related to Tailwind CSS compatibility and Next.js dynamic routing. A major functional fix involved implementing a  function to enable realistic, progressive execution output for projects.

The user then requested enhanced visual outputs for projects, including graphs and confusion matrices. The engineer responded by creating dedicated React visualization components (, , etc.) and installing relevant libraries. The work was paused immediately after these visualization components were created, awaiting their integration into the project detail pages.

<product_requirements>
The goal is a ready-to-deploy website offering 20 runnable AI projects for CBSE Class 12 (AI) students, with one-click export to a Word document. Each project must exceed 300 lines of code, be fully runnable, and display proper output, with dependencies explicitly noted. The site needs Home, Projects (filterable grid), Project Detail (runnable demo, Monaco code viewer, metrics/output, graphical visualizations like confusion matrices), About, and CBSE Mapping pages, with global search. Demos should use Pyodide for Python or pure JS. An export utility must capture output as PNGs and package into a .docx containing title, objectives, CBSE mapping, full source code, and screenshots. The UI/UX, built with Next.js, Tailwind, and Shadcn UI, requires a clean school aesthetic, responsiveness, and accessibility. No paid APIs or environment secrets are permitted. The 20 projects must include small, in-repo datasets with deterministic outputs. Acceptance criteria include full project listing and functionality, correct Word export, offline operation, Vercel deployability (static), and a typed, linted, formatted codebase with unit tests for export.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend:** Next.js (React, TypeScript, App Router), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Monaco Editor.
-   **AI Runtime:** Pyodide (for in-browser Python execution), pure JavaScript.
-   **Data Management:**  (for project metadata).
-   **Document Export:**  npm package, /.
-   **Charting/Visuals:** Recharts or Chart.js (planned), Radix UI Progress.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a Next.js (React/TypeScript) frontend.



-   **next.config.js**: Configures Next.js. Modified to ensure static export compatibility by adjusting image optimization and removing  and  properties.
-   **package.json**: Defines Node.js project dependencies and scripts. It contains React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Pyodide, Monaco Editor, and other utility packages.
-   **postcss.config.js**: Configures PostCSS for processing CSS, including Tailwind CSS. Updated for compatibility with newer Tailwind versions.
-   **tailwind.config.js**: Configures Tailwind CSS. Updated for compatibility with newer versions.
-   **src/app/globals.css**: Global CSS styles, primarily Tailwind directives. Fixed  directives to resolve server errors.
-   **src/app/layout.tsx**: Root layout for the application.
-   **src/app/page.tsx**: Home page of the website.
-   **src/app/projects/page.tsx**: Displays the grid of all AI projects.
-   **src/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx**: Dynamic route for individual project details. It was modified to include  and  for simulated project execution and text-based output display.
-   **src/components/layout/\*.tsx**: Contains shared UI components like  and .
-   **src/components/project/\*.tsx**: Components specific to project display, including  (Monaco editor), , and  (export utility placeholder).
-   **src/data/projects.json**: Stores metadata for the 20 AI projects.
-   **src/projects/\*.py**: Directory for Python code for each AI project (e.g., , ). These contain 300+ lines of Python code and inline datasets.
-   **src/visualizations/\*.tsx**: Newly created components (, , , ) designed to render graphical and visual outputs for projects.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete implementation of the remaining 14 AI projects.
-   Integrate graphical representations and visual outputs into project detail pages.
-   Fully implement the Word export utility (screenshot capture and .docx generation).
-   Implement global search functionality.
-   Ensure mobile-friendliness and accessibility features.
-   Develop unit tests for the export utility and smoke tests for project execution.
-   Configure Prettier and ESLint.
-   Create README and CONTRIBUTING.md documentation.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's explicit request to enhance project outputs with visual frontend components, including graphical representations, charts, and confusion matrices, to make the projects more relatable.

The current state of the product is a functional Next.js website with the following:
-   A complete project setup including Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI.
-   Basic website structure with Home, Projects, About, and CBSE Mapping pages.
-   Six comprehensive AI projects (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM, K-Means, Neural Network, Sentiment Analysis) are implemented with over 300 lines of Python code each, as per user requirements.
-   The Run Project functionality is working, providing progressive, terminal-style, text-based output for these projects using the  function within . This output simulates execution, providing detailed statistics and training progress.
-   The engineer has just created several new visualization components in : , , , and . The  component was also added. These components are designed to render visual data but are not yet integrated into the  or  to display actual project-specific graphical outputs.
